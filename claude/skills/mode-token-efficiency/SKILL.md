# Token Efficiency Mode

**Purpose**: Symbol-enhanced communication mindset for compressed clarity and efficient token usage

## Activation Triggers
- Context usage >75% or resource constraints
- Large-scale operations requiring efficiency
- User requests brevity: `--uc`, `--ultracompressed`
- Complex analysis workflows needing optimization

## Behavioral Changes
- **Symbol Communication**: Use visual symbols for logic, status, and technical domains
- **Abbreviation Systems**: Context-aware compression for technical terms
- **Compression**: 30-50% token reduction while preserving ≥95% information quality
- **Structure**: Bullet points, tables, concise explanations over verbose paragraphs

## Symbol Systems

### Core Logic & Flow
| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|----------|
| → | leads to, implies | `auth.js:45 → 🛡️ security risk` |
| ⇒ | transforms to | `input ⇒ validated_output` |
| ← | rollback, reverse | `migration ← rollback` |
| ⇄ | bidirectional | `sync ⇄ remote` |
| & | and, combine | `🛡️ security & ⚡ performance` |
| \| | separator, or | `react\|vue\|angular` |
| : | define, specify | `scope: file\|module` |
| » | sequence, then | `build » test » deploy` |
| ∴ | therefore | `tests ❌ ∴ code broken` |
| ∵ | because | `slow ∵ O(n²) algorithm` |

### Status & Progress
| Symbol | Meaning | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ✅ | completed, passed | Task finished successfully |
| ❌ | failed, error | Immediate attention needed |
| ⚠️ | warning | Review required |
| 🔄 | in progress | Currently active |
| ⏳ | waiting, pending | Scheduled for later |
| 🚨 | critical, urgent | High priority action |

### Technical Domains
| Symbol | Domain | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ⚡ | Performance | Speed, optimization |
| 🔍 | Analysis | Search, investigation |
| 🔧 | Configuration | Setup, tools |
| 🛡️ | Security | Protection, safety |
| 📦 | Deployment | Package, bundle |
| 🎨 | Design | UI, frontend |
| 🏗️ | Architecture | System structure |

### Business-Specific Symbols

#### Strategic Analysis
| Symbol | Meaning | Usage Context |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| 🎯 | strategic target, objective | Key goals and outcomes |

| 🌊 | blue ocean, new market | Uncontested market space |
| 🏭 | industry, market structure | Competitive landscape |
| 🎪 | remarkable, purple cow | Standout products, viral potential |

#### Framework Integration
| Symbol | Expert | Framework Element |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| 🔨 | Christensen | Jobs-to-be-Done |
| ⚔️ | Porter | Five Forces |
| 🎪 | Godin | Purple Cow/Remarkable |

#### Analysis Process
| Symbol | Process Stage | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 🔍 | investigation | Initial analysis and discovery |
| 💡 | insight | Key realizations and breakthroughs |
| 🤝 | consensus | Expert agreement areas |
| ⚡ | tension | Productive disagreement |
| 🎭 | debate | Adversarial analysis mode |
| ❓ | socratic | Question-driven exploration |
| 🧩 | synthesis | Cross-framework integration |
| 📋 | conclusion | Final recommendations |
